# Berkeley-SETI-work  Please provide a "README" for the github to explain what the script is about, for yourself in the future down the road, and also for people who visit your github.
This script is about being able to interpret data signals from a signal that is 14.6 billion miles away. Isn't that wonderful? 
Code like this is not only able to inerpret data from the Voyager 1, but it is also able to aid scientists, potentially like myself, to be able to interpret important radio signals(in this case, from the Voyager 1). 
For the future of scientis, the brilliance of this code enables them to percieve radio signals from deep in space. Code like this will be used in the future to interpret signals from a possible ET.
People who visit this code should take a minute to be aware of how awesome it is that we are able to percieve these deep space messages from our own personal computer.
